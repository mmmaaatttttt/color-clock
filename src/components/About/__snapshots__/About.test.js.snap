    <h2>
      Make time visible.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For folks who can't tell time and have a hard time with transitions (e.g. small children), color clocks give a clear visual that tells them how close they are to an upcoming transition. Time-telling skills not required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Color clocks smoothly transition between three different phases: start, warning and end. You control what time each phase should start and what each phase should look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to make a color clock:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Click 
        <a
          href="/"
        >
          here
        </a>
         to fill out the color clock form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select a time for the clock to start.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select a color for the start time (defaults to 
        <span
          style="background-color: rgb(122, 231, 185);"
        >
          green
        </span>
        ).
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the warning time and the ending time (colors default to 
        <span
          style="background-color: rgb(255, 236, 158);"
        >
          yellow
        </span>
         and 
        <span
          style="background-color: rgb(254, 173, 205);"
        >
          red
        </span>
        , respectively).
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the button to create your clock.
      </li>
      <li>
        (Optional.) Bookmark the clock page to revisit it any day in the future. The clock will remember the times and colors you selected!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Please note that times must all be for the same calendar day. For example, it's not possible to make a clock that starts at 11:30 PM and ends at 1:00 AM the next day.
